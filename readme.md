# Platform

A stupid goal given project started in 2014. Basis of a very basic videogame 2D engine based SDL2 library. Supports very primitive form of mouse and keyboard input, purple rectangle drawing and exception/logging engine.

It's on github for strict references purpose in my portfolio.

Written in pure C++, using sdl, glm and glew.

Won't build on VS 2015/2017.

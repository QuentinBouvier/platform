# Platform

A stupid goal given project started in 2014. 
Basis of a very basic videogame 2D engine based on SDL2 library. 
Supports very primitive form of mouse and keyboard input, physics engine, rectangle drawing and exception/logging engine.

It's on github for strict references purpose in my portfolio.

Written in pure C++, using sdl, glm and glew.

Builds on release in VS 2017 with sdl2-2.0.7, input system no longer works :(
